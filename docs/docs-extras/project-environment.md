# Project Environment

## Learn more about the project environment on Clouddley.

The Project environment is divided into two:
- Development/Test
- Production

Let's dive deeper into each of them.

### Development/Test
This is an environment that is meant to be used for personally testing out apps or within an organization. Applications deployed on a development Project is not suitable for interfacing with users. They are primarily for testing and staging apps. For example:
- A pet project/app you want to show your friends.
- Internal organisation app.
- Local testing and debugging.

Development/Test Projects are **NOT** built to scale.

### Production
This environment is suitable for Production workloads. Auto-scaling is enabled by default. Applications deployed under this project can be interfaced with end users and clients. For example:
- A production Nodejs, Go, PHP, Ruby, etc. applications
- An ecommerce store that interacts with free and paying users
